Using the OpenWeather, Google Places and Google Directions APIs, we have devised an application designed to filter a set of randomly determined cities based on minimum and maximum temperature preference for the traveler. Included in our analysis is a Google Marker map showing City location and weather details and a Google Directions map designed to show the proposed itinerary of the traveler based on 4 selected cities.
